# quoteData
This was code for the Excel workbook modules used to control the release process for Quote Data at cfm Distributors, Inc.

Upon completion and handoff it was outfitted with a GUI admin interface with options for handling releases.

All of this code is dated and no longer in production. It just samples of my professional work over the years.
